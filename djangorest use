to use an djando app by a third party app, it needs an api to communicate
as django apps are completely integrated with front -bavkend, if we want to use someother frontend we can use django api related to our django app to communicate with front end like react or vue


1> first create a basic django app with models
2> create an api app for the basic django app created above, using django rest framework
add rest_framework app in installed app of settings.py
    genericsapiviews can fetch data from database but to display them on web we need to serialize and convert the python objects to json representation usin serializers

    if images are part of model a media folder needs to be created and its url and root should be part of urls.py of main project folder and not app to properly function.  also add media_root and media_url in settings.py. pillow module also need to install.


3> for two apps to interact that are on different domain or different ports, a module called django-cors-headers is needed
    add 'corsheaders' in installed app of settings.py, it is also a middleware so add it in middleware
    "corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware" <-- this will allow resource sharimg between two apps
    also add the whitelist path for corsheaders:
        CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST=['http://localhost:8000', 'http://localhost:3000']    <--ADD THE ADDRESS OR DOMAIN/URL
    port '3000' is for react app

4>create an front end to consume the created django api
    react frontend app:
        install node.js from its website
        create a project folder for react out of django project, and cd to it
        
        to create react app it will create the boiler plate code and project directories:
            
            >>>npx create-react-app app_name
            
            >>>cd app_name
            
            #this will start react server
            >>>npm start
            
inside# myapp/src/app.js
